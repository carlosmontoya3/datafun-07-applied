# datafun-07-applied

## Module 7 Instructions
In this final module, you'll employ machine learning (ML). At a high-level, there are three general categories of ML: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We'll employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model and use the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line) to make predictions. Python makes it easy! 

### Objective
Build a model
Make predictions
Visualize the model
Publish your insights
